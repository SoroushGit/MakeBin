This code is writen for generating binary in StarterAgent2D base.
 
After downloading it, give it the permission to execute by typing the following command:

chmod +x MakeBinary

After that move it to you team directory and run it by typing:

./MakeBinary

So a folder called TeamBin will be generated wich is you team binary.
Now go to TeamBin directory and open the start.sh file and change the LIBPATH in line 12 to './lib/' so your team will read the library from lib folder.

Now You can compress your team Binary.
